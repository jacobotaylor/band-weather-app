### Description

We built this site using Api's, JS, Bulma, Css and Html. We thought of this idea from scratch and decided it would be fun to create a project like this.

### Visuals

### Usage

This site is used to add some fun to getting the weather. You put a city name in the search field then hit search. You will then be presented with the current temperature and wind speed. Along with a gif representation of the forcast such as, Sunny, Clear, Raining, etc. Made for information and entertainment.
